# Auto Feeder for rodents
This project is a DIY automatic feeding system for my pet rodent (r.i.p.). It uses an arduino, along with a Servo-motor connected to a tube, which contains rodent food. Every set interval (in this case 10 hours), a standard amount of food is released from the tube and into the feeding tray below.

### Warning
Since this is a feeding system meant to be for living organisms, make sure to first of all check the code (reduce time interval to a minute or so and see that the correct amount of food is dropped), as well as always make sure to check on your pets daily. This isn't meant to be a fire and forget solution to having a pet, more so a convenience/emergency solution for when you aren't there to feed said pet.
